# JAVA KPL Producer

In this example, we show how to leverage the KPL to perform asynchronous aggregation of records.  In this architecture we have 2 producers producing records to the same stream in different languages.  

Note that the KPL is not optimized for lambda and this example should serve only as a simple proof of concept.
